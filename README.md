## Project Summary

The Smart Traffic Management System is an IoT-based solution designed to optimize traffic flow and prioritize emergency vehicles on the road. Using various sensors and actuators, the system detects traffic conditions and emergency vehicles, then adjusts traffic lights accordingly to ensure efficient traffic management.

## Features

- **Traffic Detection:** Utilizes sensors to detect the presence of traffic at intersections.
- **Emergency Vehicle Detection:** Identifies approaching emergency vehicles using dedicated sensors.
- **Dynamic Traffic Light Control:** Adjusts traffic lights in real-time based on traffic conditions and emergency vehicle presence.
- **Web Server Interface:** Provides a web-based interface for remote monitoring and control of the system.

## Components

- **Traffic Sensor:** Detects the presence of vehicles at intersections.
- **Emergency Vehicle Sensor:** Identifies approaching emergency vehicles.
- **Traffic Lights:** Controls the flow of traffic at intersections.
- **WiFi Module:** Enables communication with the web server for remote monitoring and control.
